-  Hi, I’m @lukesmith-git, I hate the emojis that were preset in the readme!
-  I’m interested in pure mathematics, mostly, but I am enjoying learning more about data science/machine learning.
-  Working on odd projects and looking to break into the industry!
-  How to reach me: lukesmithworkandstuff@gmail.com
